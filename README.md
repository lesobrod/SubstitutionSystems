## Introduction
Substitution System is a map which uses a set of rules to transform elements of a sequence  
into a new sequence using a set of rules which "translate" from the original sequence to its transformation. 
For example, the substitution system `{1->0,0->11}` would take `10->011->1100->001111->11110000->...`

## Types of objects
Currently functions work for strings and 1D arrays (vectors).
